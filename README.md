## Description 

This is a portfolio site which I intend to use to shows my skills and expertise. Potential clients and recruiters can explore the site to evaluate my skills and explore past projects. The essence of this project is to showcase my understanding of all topics which I have learnt so far in this course. 

I have used grid CSS, inline, inline-block, flexbox and box-model to present the layout on the page. This project has further improved my knowledge of HTML and CSS, specifically, grid, media query and flexbox. I've carried out extensive research on Media query, CSS grid, and layouts, and how to apply it to webpage layout. As a result, I have applied my understanding of this topic to make the code for this webpage more concise and easier to maintain while adhering to best practices.
